                    Home cooks are our heroes; it's as simple as that. 
                    Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: 
                    The cooks who will dedicate two days to a perfect beef bourguignon
                    but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers
                    who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily 
                    doctor boxed brownies for a rich weeknight dessert. The entertainers 
                    who just want a solid snack spread, without spending the whole evening 
                    shuffling dishes in and out of the oven. Most importantly, Allrecipes 
                    connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration â€” other 
                    home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that 
                    inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community vibrant. 
                    Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.

                        <p>Founded in 1997 as CookieRecipe.com, Allrecipes changed the food

                            another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The
